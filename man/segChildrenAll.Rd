\usage{
segChildrenAll(
  object,
  segment,
  include.self = F,
  original.joins = F,
  format = c("unary", "binary")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An URD object}

\item{segment}{(Character) Name of segment to start from}

\item{include.self}{(Logical) Should \code{segment} be included in the list of children?}

\item{original.joins}{(Logical) Should children be drawn from \code{@tree$segment.joins} (\code{FALSE}) or
\code{@tree$segment.joins.initial} (\code{TRUE})? (\code{@tree$segment.joins.initial} reflects the process
of constructing the tree and includes all initial starting tips. \code{@tree$segment.joins} reflects the
final structure of the tree, after segments have been removed due to insufficient members or pseudotime length.)}

\item{format}{(Character: "unary" or "binary") Reflects the storage structure of \code{@tree$segment.joins}. \code{binary}
is only used internally, and all user queries should be \code{unary}.}
}
\description{
Returns the segment ids of all segments that are children (and grandchildren and great-grandchildren...)
of a parent segment specified.
