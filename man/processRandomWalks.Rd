\title{Process random walks into visitation frequency}
\usage{
processRandomWalks(
  object,
  walks,
  walks.name,
  aggregate.fun = mean,
  n.subsample = 10,
  verbose = T
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An URD object}

\item{walks}{(List) List of character vectors of cells visited during random walks (i.e. the output of \code{\link{simulateRandomWalk}})}

\item{walks.name}{(Character) Name to use for storing walks}

\item{aggregate.fun}{(Function) Function to aggregate pseudotime (default: mean)}

\item{n.subsample}{(Numeric) Number of subsamplings to perform for calculating}

\item{verbose}{(Logical) Report on progress}
}
\value{
An URD object with cell visitation frequency stored in \code{@diff.data}, a calculated pseudotime stored in \code{@pseudotime}, and
subsampled data in \code{@pseudotime.stability}.
}
\description{
The output of \code{\link{simulateRandomWalk}} is vectors of cells visited by 
each random walk. This converts that data into the visitation frequency of each
cell by the random walks, in addition to generating an independent pseudotime
for that particular trajectory, which can be useful for some analyses.
