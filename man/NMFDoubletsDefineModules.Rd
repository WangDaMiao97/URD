\title{NMF Doublets: Calculate module pair overlap}
\usage{
NMFDoubletsDefineModules(
  object,
  modules.use,
  module.thresh.high = 0.3,
  module.thresh.low = 0.15
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An URD object}

\item{modules.use}{(Character vector) Modules to consider (i.e. column names of \code{@nmf.c1})}

\item{module.thresh.high}{(Numeric) High threshold to use for 'expression' of an NMF module}

\item{module.thresh.low}{(Numeric) Lower threshold to use for 'expression' of an NMF module}
}
\value{
(List) For use in \code{\link{NMFDoubletsPlotModuleThresholds}} and \code{\link{NMFDoubletsDetermineCells}}
}
\description{
This considers NMF module expression within cells pairwise
to determine how many cells have overlapping expression of that pair of
modules. It generates a list that can be used as input into
\code{\link{NMFDoubletsPlotModuleThresholds}} to choose which module pairs to
use for selection and then \code{\link{NMFDoubletsDetermineCells}} to identify
cells that express multiple NMF modules that should not overlap and thus seem
to be doublets.
}
\details{
Two thresholds are used to determine whether a cell 'expresses'
a module -- this helps differentiate between totally distinct modules (in
which case the number of co-expressing cells is similar with either threshold)
from pairs of modules expressed in an overlapping gradient (in which case
the number of cells that co-express them increases dramatically as the threshold
is lowered).

Cells that express a pair of modules that are totally distinct are often
useful for identifying doublets -- where one detected cell contains cells that
are highly expressing two cell type programs that don't usually occur together.
Excluding module pairs that are expressed in an overlapping gradient is important,
however, as these often identify cells that are participating in a developmental
transition and should not be excluded.

This function requires that a matrix of NMF modules expression per cell is put
into slot \code{@nmf.c1}. It should be a sparse matrix of class dgCMatrix
(\code{object@nmf.c1 <- as(as.matrix(nmf.modules), 'dgCMatrix')}), where rows
are cells and columns are modules. In general, we generally normalize each
module from 0-1 across all cells.
